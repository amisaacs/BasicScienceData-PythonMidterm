# BasicScienceData-PythonMidterm
Create report of US census data by region with data arranged by state.

Midterm Project - Basic Science Data
class:  CPS141-Python
school: Washtenaw Community College
instr:  Jing Bai.

notes:  22 Sept 2019
I am using this project to practice Test Driven Development (TDD) and connecting commits to a repository.
Instead of using business rules to develop the tests, I use the directions for the midterm project.  
I suspect that this will make the coding a bit more direct  and not quite mirror real world.
For example, one of the directions is to create a python dictionary. A business rule would never state that.
